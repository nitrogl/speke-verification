 * === Patched SPEKE protocol - ISO standard of 2017 ===
 * The protocol originally computes the common group generator from a
 * pre-shared secret. It uses the group exponentiation to generate
 * the material to generate future session keys. The security of the
 * scheme is based on the hardness of the inverse operation, i.e. the
 * discrete logarithm.
 * The key confirmation message is a hash of previous sent messages,
 * the password, the key material, the identities, and the session.
